          <h3>The legends are true</h3>
          <p>Following a recent archeological discovery that suggested that a long thought myth might actually be true, a small group of rogue magical individuals have set off to free the legendary conquerors of the past. Realizing the danger this poses, four shape-shifters from the world of Detrevni have set off to find the only four people who can prevent absolute chaos from taking over.</p>

          <p>Venture out as each of the four hereos as they travel between worlds in an attempt to stop the most dangerous conquerors in history. Explore cities and towns as you search for secret dungeons where you'll have to solve puzzles and fight off against each of the legendary conquerors.</p>

          <h3>The Myth We Were Told</h3>
          <p>Thousands of years ago, there was a very powerful woman with magical abilities. She cared deeply for those who were like her and the creatures that possesed a magical aura. After years of mistreatment of those she cared about she became absolutely fed up with how things were here on Earth. She gathered a few others with magical abilities and using their combined power they harnessed the magic of their surroundings to create a new world. Unbeknownst to them, this new world was linked to Earth and any major events on Earth would be mirrored in their world.</p>

          <p>This is the entrance room to the first dungeon for one of the characters you can play as. You will have to explore the different sections of the dungeon and collect three items corresponding to the three pedestals in this room. Once collected, you can interact with the item's pedestal to place it on top and activate the pedestal. After activating all three pedestals, the staircase in the middle will open up, allowing you access to the room with the dungeon's final item.</p>
          
          <p>Currently, the items and the rest of the dungeon have not been implemented so for the moment, simply interacting with the pedestals will activate them (shown by the change in color). The three doors near each pedestal are also locked until the player solves the in room puzzle to unlock each door and thus a section of the dungeon.</p>
